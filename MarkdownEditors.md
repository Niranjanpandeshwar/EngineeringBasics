# Markdown

Is a plain text format that can be used to express stylized text rendered as html (or even pdf). It is commonly used in online tools such as Github to make it easier to write reports or documentation. You can mix and match html with markdown, but there are limits, e.g. including a link to a css file.

How about an example. The following markdown syntax, would appear as follows:

```
##### Example Header (like \<h5\>Header\</h5\>)

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.  A hard break can be created by adding two spaces after a sentance.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace` (inline code). 
```

### Lists, Blockquotes, Hrefs, and Images

You can do more advanced things, such as creating lists
```
Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

Hrefs have an anchor in brackets [] and (link in parens): [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

### Code

```
Code (`inline code`):

    print “Code is just indented four spaces”;
```

Code (`inline code`):

    print “Code is just indented four spaces”;

You can also create code using "code fences" 

    ```python
    n = 50 # We want to find prime numbers between 2 and 50

    print sorted(set(range(2,n+1)).difference(set((p * f) for p in range(2,int(n**0.5) + 2) for f in range(2,(n/p)+1))))
    ```

```python
n = 50 # We want to find prime numbers between 2 and 50

print sorted(set(range(2,n+1)).difference(set((p * f) for p in range(2,int(n**0.5) + 2) for f in range(2,(n/p)+1))))
```

### Tables

There are many different "flavors" of markdown. [Github-flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/) supports "tables". Which can be nice to report data results:

```

### Editors

If you're still opening and editing files in Notepad.exe, let's show you a better way.

When editing markdown and code scripts, features such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and advanced find and replace tools are essential!

## Practice: Create an About me Page

#### Step 1: Create a Markdown Page

Add a AboutMe.md file to your data challenge repo. Include the following details:

* Something about you.
* Where you are from and your school.
* A picture.
* A list of skills
* A link to your mentor
* If brave, a table and a favorite code snippet.

#### Step 2: gh-pages

* Create a branch in you data challenge repo, called "gh-pages"
* Switch to gh-pages branch
* Using pandoc or dilliger.io export, create a html version of your markdown file.
* Commit and push a AboutMe.html file

Example: You can see how the branch  
Gh-Pages: https://github.com/StartupBot/MobileTouch/tree/gh-pages  
will point to the website: http://startupbot.github.io/MobileTouch/  

Advanced: You can use a static site generator such as jekyll to generate html from markdown and push to your github pages.
