# Shells

A shell is a computing environment where commands can be interpreted, evaluated, and its output displayed (i.e., an instance of a read–eval–print loop (REPL)). A good shell provides access to a rich set of commands and allows simple programming of commands, which can be used to create powerful scripts and tools.

But with great power comes great [bullshittery](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm). Commands and their options can be terse, inconsistent, and difficult to learn. A steep learning curve often prevents novices from enjoying the eventual payoff.

If you've hardly used a command line environment before, you might want to go review this more thorough tutorial:

### Tips for Windows Users

Skip to Package Managers, and install gnuwin basic utils for windows: `choco install gnuwin32-coreutils.install`. Install git (`choco install git`). Add to your System Environment Variables Path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin`, and `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`.
Restart with a new shell.

* Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. You can run "Git Bash" to get this slightly improved command prompt.
* Powershell is a new shell for windows.
* Windows 10 will soon support a native bash shell! Stay tuned.

### Shell Basics

The UNIX shell tools push data from sources through filters along pipes:

```bash
command
command < inputFile
command > outputFile
command1 | command2 # pipes
command &           # run in background
```

##### Command Line Fu

A list of command line examples for interesting tasks:  
http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse

Essential commands:

* **ls**: list content of a directory.
* **cd**: change directories to a new path.
* **mkdir**: make a new directory.
* **pwd**: output current directory
* **cp**: copy files
* **rm**: rm files
* **touch**: make a new file/update status**
* **cat**: output the contents of a file.
* **head**: output the first lines of a file.
* **tail**: output the last lines of a file.
* **grep**: search files for a key phrase.
* **wget**: retrieve file from the web.
* **cut**: extract output of a file (columns)
* **awk** and **sed**: Magic commands for extracting, searching, and transforming content.

## Practice: Importing a CSV file

* Download the Product Hunt Data `wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/producthunt-downloads/ph-export--2016-04-01.tar.gz`
* Extract dataset: `tar -zxvf ph-export--2016-04-01.tar.gz`
* Change into product-hunt folder.
* Inspect the file contents: `head posts--2016-04-01_14-36-24-UTC.csv`
* Estimate number of contents: `cat posts--2016-04-01_14-36-24-UTC.csv | wc -l`

#### More practice

* Write a simple shell script to find the largest file  
Hint: (loop through each file in directory and run `wc -l`

## Advanced: Shell Programming

The shell is a general programming langauge:

```bash
e=expansion
$e
$(command)
'literal string'
"string with \$ $e"
```

Command can run sequetially or conditionally:

```bash
command1 ; command2
(command1 ; command2) # in a sub-shell
command1 || command2  # do command2 only if command1 fails
command1 && command2  # do command2 only if command1 succeeds
```

Usual conditionals and loops:

```bash
if command; then
   commands
fi

while command; do
  commands
done

while read var; do
   commands
done

# looping over lists
for var in a b c; do
   commands # that can access $var
done

# looping over numerics
for((x=1;x<=10;x++); do
   commands # that can access $x
done

case word in
pattern1) commands1;;
pattern2) commands2;;
esac
```
